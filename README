Bitweaver TicketsPackage package creator

Based on the instructions from http://www.bitweaver.org/wiki/TicketsPackage 
the mkpackage script creates a basic outline of a package which uses the
Liberty CMS.

To use the script move (or copy) the file out out the tickets directory and into where 
ever you want to create the package.

The package is created in the current working directory.

The script will get the tickets package if it is not already available.
It will get the package in one of the following ways:-
* Using wget, this is the default the tickets package is downloaded from:
	http://www.bitweaver.org/builds/packages/bitweaver_tickets_package.tar.gz
* Using Anonymous CVS, this gets you the latest version of the tickets package
	cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sf.net:/cvsroot/bitweaver co tickets
* Using CVS, this option uses the current CVS settings
	cvs co tickets

Usage: mkpackage [options] packagename
Options:
	-cvs	Get tickets package from CVS if needed
	-wget	Get tickets package from the web if needed (via wget) (DEFAULT)
	-dev    If getting the tickets package from CVS get with current CVS defaults 
	-anon	If getting the tickets package from CVS get from anon CVS (DEFAULT)

KNOWN ISSUES
* Selecting Anonymous CVS when using a "ext" CVS tree causes a conflict, use -dev as well
* If the tickets package already exists in the current working directory it is used to make
	the new package.
* If using wget the tar file is left in the current working directory, it will be used if
	another package is created, but can be safely deleted.
